# RMG Product Management Task

Hello, this is a test project for a Frontend function. I used the latest version of the Angular framework. I also used Angular Material & Tailwind CSS. I used intelligence in several areas: reviewing the code, improving the UI, testing performance, and writing some formatting.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Angular 21.1.2** - Latest version of Angular framework
- **Angular Material** - Material Design components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed programming language
- **Transloco** - Internationalization (i18n) solution for Angular
- **Signals** - Modern reactive state management

## ✨ Features

- 📦 **Product Management** - Full CRUD operations for products
- 📄 **Invoice Management** - Create, view, edit, and delete invoices with line items
- 🌐 **Internationalization** - Full support for English and Arabic languages (RTL)
- 🌗 **Dark Mode** - Beautiful dark theme support
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly on all device sizes
- ♿ **Accessibility** - WCAG AA compliant with proper ARIA attributes
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Clean, professional interface with smooth animations

```

## 🛠️ Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## 🏗️ Building

To build the project for production:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory with optimizations for performance and speed.

## 🎯 Code Quality

- **TypeScript Strict Mode** - Enhanced type safety
- **OnPush Change Detection** - Optimized performance
- **Standalone Components** - Modern Angular architecture
- **Signal-based State** - Reactive and predictable state management
